H.W. :  Difference between List(add,append,extend)
		List inside List (FlatList)
		Shallow and Deep Copy
		Difference between title and capitalize
	
Shallow and Deep Copy:
 l = [1,2,3,4]
 l1 = l (Deep copy) ... if you change value of l, l1 also changes. (connect with reference id)
 l1 = l.copy() (Shallow Copy) ... value doesnt change with l. 
 
Difference between title and capitalize:

str = 'hello world ! welcome to greyatom'

str.title()
str ='Hello World ! Welcome To Greyatom'

str.capitalize()
str = 'Hello world ! welcome to greyatom'
