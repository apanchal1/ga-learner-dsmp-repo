HW:
1) basics of matrix and its application
2) KNN algorithm for python - Default no. of neighbours are 5
3) No. of neighbours should be odd
4) How we can find out data using even no. of neighbours
5) If we specify no. of neighbours explicitly is called Hyperparameter
6)  Accuracy = 1 - [(Actual - estimated)/estimated]*100
7) How to find accuracy of the model --> Training-Test split (70:30)
8) Set seed --> Psuedo random number generator --universally idnetical
9) Classification vs Regression
	Classification --> Works on Mode in KNN
	Regression -->  Works on Mean in KNN
10) D3( ) Dash library in Python
11) Scikit-learn libraray works on numerical data only

12 )cosine-similarity range(-1,1)

13) Standardization and Normalization
	Scaling for Standardization --> (-1,1)
	Scaling for Normalization --> (0,1)
	Scaling is used to reduce computation time
